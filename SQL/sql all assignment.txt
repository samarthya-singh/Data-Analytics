4) Update Lesley Bland’s phone number to 215-555-8800

  UPDATE Employee
SET Phone = '215-555-8800'

6).In ContactEmployee table, the statement that removes Dianne Connor’s contact
event with Jack Lee (one statement).

DELETE FROM ContactEmployee
WHERE ContactEmployeeID = (
    SELECT ce.ContactEmployeeID
    FROM ContactEmployee ce
    JOIN Contact c ON ce.ContactID = c.ContactID
    JOIN Employee e ON ce.EmployeeID = e.EmployeeID
    WHERE c.FirstName = 'Dianne'
      AND c.LastName = 'Connor'
      AND e.FirstName = 'Jack'
      AND e.LastName = 'Lee'
);

7). What is the significance of “%” and “_” operators in the LIKE statement? 

% means: match any number of characters (0 or more).
_ means: match exactly one character.

8).Explain Normalization in the Context of Databases

Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy (duplicate data) and improve data integrity.
It divides large tables into smaller, related tables and defines relationships between them.

a.First Normal Form (1NF)

No repeating groups

Each column contains atomic (single) values

b. Second Normal Form (2NF)

Must be in 1NF

No partial dependency on part of a composite key

c. Third Normal Form (3NF)

Must be in 2NF

No transitive dependencies (non-key column should not depend on another non-key column)

10) What does a JOIN in MySQL mean?

A JOIN in MySQL is used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them.

It allows you to retrieve data that is spread across multiple tables by matching rows using a common field (usually a primary key and a foreign key).



11.)

What do you understand about DDL, DCL, and DML in MySQL?

In MySQL, SQL commands are divided into categories based on what they do. The three most important categories are DDL, DML, and DCL.

a. DDL – Data Definition Language

DDL is used to define or modify the structure of database objects
(tables, views, indexes, schemas).

🔹 Common DDL Commands:

CREATE – create a table or database

ALTER – modify a table

DROP – delete a table

TRUNCATE – delete all rows quickly

RENAME – rename an object


b.DML – Data Manipulation Language

DML is used to insert, update, delete, and retrieve data.

d. Common DML Commands:

SELECT – read data

INSERT – add data

UPDATE – modify data

DELETE – remove data

c.DCL – Data Control Language

DCL is used to control access and permissions in the database.

c. Common DCL Commands:

GRANT – give user permissions

REVOKE – remove permissions

12.)What is the role of the MySQL JOIN clause in a query, and what are some common types of joins?
Role of the MySQL JOIN clause:

The JOIN clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them.
It allows you to retrieve data that is stored across multiple tables by linking them through keys (usually primary key and foreign key).

In short:
 JOIN helps you fetch connected data from multiple tables in a single query.

Common Types of Joins in MySQL
1INNER JOIN

Returns only the rows where both tables have matching values.

SELECT * 
FROM A 
INNER JOIN B ON A.id = B.id;

2 LEFT JOIN (LEFT OUTER JOIN)

Returns all rows from the left table and only matching rows from the right table.

3 RIGHT JOIN (RIGHT OUTER JOIN)

Returns all rows from the right table and only matching rows from the left table.

4 FULL JOIN (FULL OUTER JOIN)

MySQL does not support FULL JOIN directly, but it can be simulated using UNION of LEFT + RIGHT join results.

5 CROSS JOIN

Returns the Cartesian product—every row of table A combined with every row of table B.
