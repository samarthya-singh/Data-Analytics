1) What is Power BI and how does it differ from Excel?

Ans.)
What is Power BI?

Power BI is a business intelligence (BI) and data visualization tool by Microsoft used to:

Connect to multiple data sources (databases, APIs, cloud, Excel, etc.)

Clean and transform data (Power Query)

Create interactive dashboards and reports

Share reports securely online or within an organization

It is mainly used for data analysis, reporting, and decision-making.

Excel → Best for calculations, small data, and quick analysis
Power BI → Best for big data, dashboards, automation, and sharing insights

**2) Explain the concept of data modeling in Power BI.
Ans.)
Data modeling in Power BI is the process of connecting multiple tables, defining relationships, and structuring data so that reports and DAX calculations work correctly and efficiently.
Why Data Modeling is Important**

Ensures accurate calculations
Improves report performance
Makes DAX formulas simpler
Enables correct filtering and slicing

3) What are the different types of connections available in Power BI?
**Ans.)
Power BI supports Import, DirectQuery, Live Connection, and Composite models to connect data based on performance, data size, and real-time requirements.
How do you handle data transformation in Power BI?**
**Ans.)
Data transformation in Power BI is handled using Power Query Editor, where raw data is cleaned, reshaped, and prepared before loading it into the data model.
What is DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) and why is it important in**
Power BI?
**Ans.)
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) is a formula language used in Power BI, Power Pivot, and SSAS to create:**

Measures

Calculated Columns

Calculated Tables

It is used to perform calculations, aggregations, and advanced analytics on data models.
DAX is important because it allows you to turn raw data into meaningful insights.

Key reasons:

Creates Business Calculations
Total Sales
Profit
Average Order Value (AOV)
Year-to-Date (YTD), Month-to-Date (MTD)
Can you explain the difference between calculated columns and
measures in Power BI?
Ans.)
Calculated Column
A calculated column is a column created using DAX that is calculated row by row and stored in the table.
Key Points
Calculated during data refresh
Uses row context
Takes memory space
Value is fixed until next refresh

A measure is a DAX calculation that is calculated at report time based on filter context.
Key Points
Calculated on the fly
Uses filter context
Does not consume storage
Values change based on:
Slicers
Filters
Visuals


How do you handle relationships between tables in Power BI?
Ans.
In Power BI, relationships are handled by defining how tables are connected using key columns, setting the correct cardinality, cross-filter direction, and active relationships so that filters and DAX calculations work correctly.
How Relationships Work in Power BI
1️⃣ Create Relationships

You can create relationships in:
Model View (drag & drop)
Manage Relationships option
2️⃣ Choose Correct Cardinality
one to one 1 1
one to many 1 *
many to many :
3️⃣Set Cross Filter Direction
Controls how filters flow between tables.
Single direction → Dimension → Fact (recommended)
Both direction → Use only when necessary
4️⃣ Active vs Inactive Relationships

Active → Used by default
Inactive → Can be activated in DAX using USERELATIONSHIP()
5️⃣ Use a Proper Data Model (Star Schema ⭐)

Best practice is to use a Star Schema:
Fact table in center (Sales)
Dimension tables around it (Date, Product, Customer)


8) What is the purpose of a Power BI Gateway?

Ans.)
Power BI Gateway enables secure connectivity between on-premises data sources and Power BI Service for scheduled refresh, DirectQuery, and live connections.
9) How can you schedule data refresh in Power BI Service?
Ans.)
Data refresh in Power BI Service is scheduled by publishing the report, configuring dataset credentials and gateway (if needed), and enabling scheduled refresh in dataset settings.


10) Explain the concept of row-level security in Power BI. 
Ans.)

Row-Level Security (RLS) in Power BI is used to restrict data access at the row level, ensuring users see only the data they are authorized to view.
these are of Two type
1.static RLS
2.Dynamic RLS


11) What is the Power BI Desktop and how does it differ from Power
BI Service? 

Ans.)
Power BI Desktop is a report development tool used to create data models and reports, while Power BI Service is a cloud-based platform used to publish, share, refresh, and collaborate on those reports.


12) Explain the concept of Direct Query in Power BI. 
Ans.)
DirectQuery is a Power BI connection mode that retrieves data in real time by sending queries directly to the source database instead of importing data into Power BI.


13) What are Power BI templates and how are they useful?
Ans.)

Power BI templates (.pbit files) are reusable report designs that contain data model, queries, measures, and visuals without the actual data, making them useful for standardization and faster report creation.

14) How do you handle incremental data refresh in Power BI? 

Ans.)
Incremental refresh in Power BI is used to refresh only new or changed data instead of the entire dataset, which improves refresh time and performance, especially for large datasets.


15) What is the role of Power Query in Power BI?
Ans.)

Power Query is the data transformation and preparation tool in Power BI used to clean, reshape, combine, and load data before it is used for reporting and DAX calculations.

16) Explain the difference between calculated columns and
calculated tables in Power BI. 

Ans.)
Calculated columns add row-level calculations to an existing table, while calculated tables create new tables using DAX for summarization or modeling purposes.


17) How do you create custom visuals in Power BI? 
Ans.)
Custom visuals in Power BI can be created by importing visuals from AppSource, developing visuals using the Power BI Visuals SDK, or using R/Python scripts for advanced visualizations.


18) What are the best practices for optimizing performance in
Power BI? 
Ans.)
Power BI performance is optimized by using a star schema, reducing data size, writing efficient DAX, preferring measures, optimizing Power Query transformations, and choosing the right storage mode.

19) How can you integrate Power BI with other Microsoft
products like Azure and Office 365? 
Ans)
Power BI integrates with Azure for secure data, analytics, and scalability, and with Office 365 tools like Excel, Teams, and SharePoint for collaboration, sharing, and embedded analytics.


20) Explain the concept of aggregations in Power BI. 
Ans)
Aggregations in Power BI improve performance by pre-summarizing large datasets so that queries can be answered using summary tables instead of detailed data.

21) How do you handle error handling and data quality in Power
BI?
Ans)
“I handle error handling and data quality in Power BI mainly using Power Query for cleaning, removing or replacing errors, validating data types, and eliminating duplicates. I use DAX functions like DIVIDE to prevent calculation errors and apply strong data modeling practices to ensure consistency and accuracy.”

22) What is the purpose of Power BI Embedded and when would
you use it? 
Ans.)

Power BI Embedded is an Azure service that allows developers to embed Power BI reports, dashboards, and visuals into custom applications such as:

Web apps
Mobile apps
Internal business applications
Customer-facing portals

Users can view Power BI content without having a Power BI account.
