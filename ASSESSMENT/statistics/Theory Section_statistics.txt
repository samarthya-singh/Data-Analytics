1. What are the key properties of a Normal Distribution?

The Normal Distribution (also called the Gaussian Distribution) is one of the most important concepts in statistics.

Bell-Shaped and Symmetrical
Mean = Median = Mode
Defined by Two Parameters
Total Area = 1 (or 100%)
Tails Never Touch X-Axis
Skewness = 0


2. Define:
o Probability Density Function 
o Z-Score
o Standard Normal Distribution

Ans)

Probability Density Function (PDF)

Definition:
A Probability Density Function (PDF) describes the likelihood of a continuous random variable taking a particular value.

Key Points:

Used for continuous data

The area under the curve = 1

Probability is calculated over an interval, not at a single point

𝑃(𝑎<𝑋<𝑏)=Area under curve between a and b
P(a<X<b)=Area under curve between a and b


Z-Score

Definition:
A Z-score tells how many standard deviations a value is away from the mean.

Standard Normal Distribution

Definition:
A Standard Normal Distribution is a normal distribution with:

Mean (μ) = 0

Standard Deviation (σ) = 1

It is also called the Z-distribution.


3. Differentiate between:
o Discrete vs. Continuous Distributions
o Binomial vs. Normal Distribution

Ans)Discrete vs Continuous Distribution

| Basis                      | Discrete Distribution                    | Continuous Distribution                    |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Meaning**                | Deals with **countable values**          | Deals with **measurable values**           |
| **Type of Data**           | Whole numbers (0,1,2,3…)                 | Any value within a range (e.g., 1.5, 2.78) |
| **Function Used**          | Probability Mass Function (PMF)          | Probability Density Function (PDF)         |
| **Probability at a Point** | Can calculate probability of exact value | Probability at exact value = 0             |
| **Example**                | Number of students in class              | Height, weight, temperature                |


Binomial vs Normal Distribution

| Basis          | Binomial Distribution                  | Normal Distribution                   |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Type**       | Discrete                               | Continuous                            |
| **Shape**      | Can be skewed or symmetric             | Always symmetric (bell-shaped)        |
| **Used For**   | Fixed number of trials with 2 outcomes | Large datasets with natural variation |
| **Parameters** | n (trials), p (probability of success) | μ (mean), σ (standard deviation)      |
| **Example**    | Tossing a coin 10 times                | Heights of people                     |



4. In a standardized test, scores follow a normal distribution with mean = 100, std.
dev = 15:
• What is the probability that a student scores above 115?
• What percentage of students scored between 85 and 115?

Ans)

Z=115−100​/15=15/15​=1

So we need:

P(Z>1)
From the Z-table:
P(Z<1)=0.8413
Therefore:
P(Z>1)=1−0.8413=0.1587

Final Answer:
P(X>115)=0.1587​

15.87% probability

2.Percentage of students between 85 and 115

Step 1: Convert both values to Z-scores

For 85:

Z=85−100/15 =−1

For 115:

Z=115−100​/15=1

So we need:

P(−1<Z<1)

From the Empirical Rule (68–95–99.7 rule):

P(−1<Z<1)≈0.6827

Final Answer:

68.27%
